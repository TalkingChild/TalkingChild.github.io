									<h3>TALKING CHILD ANNOUNCES THE VHS RELEASE OF "BABY BABBLE™ - SPEECH ENHANCING 
										VIDEO FOR BABIES AND TODDLERS"</h3>
								<p>
								Minneapolis, MN, January 15, 2004 - Talking Child, LLC proudly announced the 
								VHS release of Baby Babble™ - Speech Enhancing Video for Babies and Toddlers, 
								which focuses on speech sounds and communication in addition to language. 
								Designed for babies and toddlers ages 3 to 30 months, the Baby Babble™ video 
								exposes young children to age-specific sounds and words that lay the groundwork 
								for future communication."
								<p>
								Baby Babble™ - Speech Enhancing Video for Babies and Toddlers is a captivating 
								experience that exposes young children to age-specific sounds and words. Babies 
								will experience simple sign language, amusing facial exercises, and beginning 
								speech sounds and words while colorful toys and carefully arranged music 
								stimulate their imagination. Parents will learn how to encourage speech and 
								language at home in an educational tutorial designed by pediatric speech 
								therapists. The first video of its kind, BABY BABBLE(TM) combines playful, 
								enriching experiences with clinically-inspired speech and language techniques.
								<p>
								Created by speech pathologists, Baby Babble features a child segment and parent 
								tutorial. The child segment includes 1) facial exercises that promote muscle 
								coordination, 2) sign language that empowers children to communicate before 
								they master spoken language, 3) sounds that encourage babbling and sound play, 
								4) words that stimulate imitation, and 5) phrases that promote sequencing. The 
								12-step parent tutorial offers an introduction to speech development and 
								provides answers to questions such as "What should my child be saying?" and 
								"What can I do to encourage my child's speech?"
								<p>
								"We developed Baby Babble™ to meet the communication needs of children ages 3 
								to 30 months -- from infants that coo and goo, to beginning babblers, new 
								talkers, and phrase builders. Baby Babble™ meets young children at their level 
								so that they can master basic speech sounds before they begin to say words and 
								phrases -- just as they will learn to walk before they learn to run," said 
								co-founder Cory Poland.
								<p>
								"The Baby Babble™ video incorporates the most important aspects of child 
								language development with colorful toys and engaging music," said Amy 
								Chouinard, co-founder. "Our parent tutorial teaches techniques that we use in 
								our private practices. The techniques are simple but powerful."
								<p>
								By combining sounds, words, and sign language with carefully composed music, 
								Baby Babble offers an educational and enriching alternative to the musically 
								oriented baby videos that dominate marketplace.
								<p>
								Baby Babble™ - Speech Enhancing Video for Babies and Toddlers" (VHS) is 
								available nationwide. Baby Babble™ DVD is expected to be released April 30, 
								2004. For additional information visit our website at www.talkingchild.com.

								minutes. Ages 3-30 months.

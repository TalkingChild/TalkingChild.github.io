								<h3>School Library Journal says <EM>Baby Babble</EM> "goes beyond simple vocabulary 
									and focuses on language acquisition".

								Baby Babble, videocassette. color. approx 45 min. Talking Child. 2003, $16.99.
								<P>PreS--Created by two speech/language pathologists, this video utilizes toys and 
									music to engage babies from ages 3-30 months while introducing them to 
									appropriate speech and language concepts, including sign language. The video is 
									divided into two segments: a child portion and an adult tutorial. In the 
									section for children, the ideas presented include facial exercises that promote 
									muscle coordination, sign language and basic sounds that encourage babbling, 
									words that stimulate imitation, and phrases that promote sequencing. The vivid 
									and colorful scenes will entrance babies and young toddlers. The production is 
									interactive, encouraging children to participate by imitating the sounds and 
									actions that they see and hear. First time parents will be pleased with a 
									12-step tutorial that answers basic questions that they may have about their 
									child's language and speech development. There is also a tutorial that teaches 
									viewers ten basic signs. A chart of basic child language development skills is 
									included. The video fills a niche in the public library as it goes beyond 
									simple vocabulary and focuses on language acquisition using not only words but 
									some sounds as well. A useful purchase for large public libraries.

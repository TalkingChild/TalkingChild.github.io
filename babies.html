					"I can't say enough about this tape. I bought it because my son who is 18 
					months was not making many intelligible words. The parent tutorial helped me 
					know what to do to help him advance his speech.
					<BR>
					<br>
					I only wish I would have known about it when Enzio was younger. I concentrated 
					on all the Baby Einstein videos which now when I look back on how wonderful I 
					thought they were, I realize that they weren't, not for language skills anyway.
					<br>
					<br>
					This video was created by SPEECH PATHOLOGISTS which is why it really touches on 
					language/sign language. Don't hesitate to get this one...you won't be waisting 
					money. They use alot of sounds and show you some basic sign language to help 
					your child communicate better so&nbsp;that your child does&nbsp;not get 
					frustrated. I only hope they come out with more videos like this one. &nbsp;My 
					son watches this with me everyday and we do all the sounds &amp; signs. My son 
					just went to have his hearing tested and to be evaluated for a language delay 
					and when the speech pathologists were playing with him, I felt like I was 
					watching this video. They did almost everything that is in this video. His 
					language is already improving. This tape is one you can pop-in and if you have 
					to catch up on laundry,dishes etc., you won't feel guilty."
